# Development Preferences

## Scripting
- **Preferred**: Bash scripts (.sh files)
- **Avoid**: Node.js scripts unless absolutely necessary
- **Reason**: Keep the project clean and avoid unnecessary dependencies

## Project Structure
- Keep root directory clean
- Avoid `node_modules/` in Flutter project root
- Use platform-appropriate tooling (Flutter/Dart tools for Flutter project)

## Git Workflow
- Use feature branches for development
- Clean commits with clear messages
- Review changes before merging

*These preferences should be followed for all future development*
