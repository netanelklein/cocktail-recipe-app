# Infrastructure Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for establishing complete development infrastructure for the Cocktailian cocktail recipe app. The infrastructure includes Firebase backend services, CI/CD pipeline automation, development tooling, and production-ready deployment capabilities. This foundational infrastructure is critical for enabling efficient development workflows and ensuring reliable app delivery throughout the 24-week development timeline.

**Purpose**: Foundation infrastructure setup to support all development phases
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks (prerequisite for Phase 1)
**Dependencies**: Phase 0 (Widget Library) complete

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a fully configured Firebase backend, so that I can store and retrieve cocktail recipes, user data, and images reliably across all platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app initializes THEN Firebase SHALL connect successfully to the configured project
2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN Firebase Auth SHALL support both email/password and Google Sign-In methods
3. WHEN recipe data is stored THEN Firestore SHALL persist data with proper security rules
4. WHEN images are uploaded THEN Firebase Storage SHALL handle recipe images with appropriate access controls
5. WHEN the app runs on Android, iOS, or Web THEN Firebase SHALL function consistently across all platforms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines, so that code quality is maintained and builds are generated automatically for testing and deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN GitHub Actions SHALL run flutter analyze with zero tolerance for warnings
2. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN GitHub Actions SHALL run dart format validation
3. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN GitHub Actions SHALL execute all unit and widget tests
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the pipeline SHALL generate APK and AAB build artifacts
5. WHEN builds complete THEN artifacts SHALL be uploaded and available for download
6. WHEN coverage is calculated THEN the pipeline SHALL report test coverage metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive development tooling and project structure, so that I can develop features efficiently following established patterns and standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN all required Flutter dependencies SHALL be properly configured
2. WHEN organizing code THEN the lib/ directory structure SHALL follow established patterns (core/, data/, providers/, widgets/, screens/)
3. WHEN using state management THEN Riverpod SHALL be the exclusive state management solution
4. WHEN building UI components THEN the custom Bar* widget library SHALL be available and integrated
5. WHEN running quality checks THEN flutter analyze SHALL pass with zero warnings or errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want production-ready security and monitoring, so that the app can be safely deployed and issues can be tracked proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing Firestore data THEN security rules SHALL enforce proper user permissions and data access controls
2. WHEN the app encounters errors THEN Firebase Crashlytics SHALL capture and report crashes automatically
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN Firebase Performance SHALL track app startup time and screen rendering
4. WHEN managing environments THEN separate development and production Firebase projects SHALL be configured
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN API keys and configuration SHALL be securely managed through environment variables

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment and distribution capabilities, so that beta versions can be shared with testers and releases can be managed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN builds are ready for testing THEN Firebase App Distribution SHALL automatically distribute beta builds to testers
2. WHEN creating releases THEN the system SHALL support automated versioning and release note generation
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN manual approval gates SHALL be required for production releases
4. WHEN managing branches THEN comprehensive branch protection rules SHALL prevent direct pushes to main
5. WHEN running integration tests THEN end-to-end testing SHALL validate critical user flows automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive backup and recovery capabilities, so that data loss is prevented and the system can recover from failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored in Firestore THEN automated backup strategies SHALL preserve user data and recipes
2. WHEN system failures occur THEN recovery procedures SHALL restore service within acceptable timeframes
3. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN backup systems SHALL provide point-in-time recovery options
4. WHEN monitoring systems detect issues THEN alerts SHALL notify the development team immediately
5. WHEN privacy compliance is required THEN data retention policies SHALL be implemented and enforced
