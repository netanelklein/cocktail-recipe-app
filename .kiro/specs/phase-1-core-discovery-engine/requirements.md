# Requirements Document - Phase 1: Core Discovery Engine

## Introduction

The Core Discovery Engine is the heart of the Cocktailian app, enabling users to discover cocktail recipes based on their available ingredients. This phase implements the primary value proposition: helping home bartenders find cocktails they can make right now with ingredients they have at home.

**Duration**: Weeks 3-8 (6 weeks)  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 0 (Widget Design Library) and Issue #3 (Infrastructure Setup) complete  
**Success Criteria**: Users can manage ingredient inventory and discover cocktails in real-time

**Note**: This spec focuses specifically on the core discovery functionality. For the complete 24-week roadmap and future phases, see `../project-timeline/`.
