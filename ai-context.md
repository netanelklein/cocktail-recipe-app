**ðŸ”§ RECENT THEME UX IMPROVEMENTS:**
- âœ… **Switch Visibility**: Fixed inactive switch colors - now uses `colorScheme.outline` for thumb and `colorScheme.surfaceContainer` for track for better contrast
- âœ… **Modal Handle Visibility**: Updated bottom sheet drag handle to use `colorScheme.outline` instead of `colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant` for better visibility
- âœ… **Removed Legacy Code**: Cleaned up old `bar_theme.dart` file and updated `main.dart` to use new theme system
- âœ… **Enhanced Border Radius System**: Implemented differentiated border radius for better UX:
  - **Buttons**: 30px border radius (very rounded) for all button types (primary, secondary, tertiary, FAB)
  - **Input Fields**: 25px border radius (highly rounded) for text fields, dropdowns, search fields
  - **Cards & Chips**: 20px border radius (moderately rounded) - kept at current preferred level
